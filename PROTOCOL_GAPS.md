# Protocol Gap Analysis: wasiglk vs RemGLK/GlkOte Specification

This document tracks discrepancies between wasiglk's implementation and the official RemGLK/GlkOte JSON protocol specification. Use this as a checklist when fixing issues.

**Reference Documentation:**
- GlkOte spec: https://eblong.com/zarf/glk/glkote/docs.html
- RemGLK docs: https://eblong.com/zarf/glk/remglk/docs.html

**When fixing issues:** If you discover additional discrepancies not listed here, add them to this file before fixing.

**Testing:** When fixing protocol issues, add or update tests to verify the correct format is being sent. Tests should verify the exact JSON structure matches the GlkOte spec.

**Code style:** When processing arrays in TypeScript, prefer using `array.map()` and `array.flatMap()` over manual for-loops with result.push(). This makes the code more functional and readable.

**Backwards compatibility:** There is no need for backwards compatibility with legacy formats. We are implementing the GlkOte spec correctly - just make the changes to match the spec without supporting old formats.

**Build process:** After modifying server-side Zig code, run `./run build` to rebuild WASM files. Client-side TypeScript changes are hot-reloaded by the dev server, but if changes don't take effect, restart the server.

**No extra messages:** Only send messages defined in the RemGLK/GlkOte spec. Do not add custom messages for debugging or UI purposes - keep the protocol clean and spec-compliant.

**Commits:** Create a git commit after completing each major item (e.g., after fixing an issue and verifying tests pass). This keeps changes atomic and makes it easier to review or revert if needed.

## Protocol Deviations (Format/Structure Issues)

These are cases where wasiglk sends data in a different format than the spec requires.

### [x] 1. Init Message Flow (FIXED)

**Location:** `packages/client/src/worker/interpreter.worker.ts:56-67`, `packages/server/src/protocol.zig:524-574`

**Fixed:**
- Display now sends: `{type: "init", gen: 0, support: ["timer", "graphics", "graphicswin", "hyperlinks"], metrics: {...}}`
- Interpreter responds with first `update` message (not `init`) when the game creates windows

**Implementation:**
1. Client sends `support` array declaring its capabilities
2. Server parses support array and stores in `state.client_support` struct
3. Server no longer sends `type: "init"` response - the game's first `update` with windows serves as the response
4. Example app detects initialization from first window update instead of init message

---

### [x] 2. Graphics Window Content Uses Wrong Array Name (FIXED)

**Location:** `packages/server/src/protocol.zig:229-302`

**Current:** `{"id": 1, "draw": [{"special": "fill", ...}]}`

**Fixed:** Now uses `draw` array with `special` as a string value per GlkOte spec.

---

### [x] 3. Color Format is Integer Instead of CSS String (FIXED)

**Location:** `packages/server/src/protocol.zig:259-302`

**Current:** `{"color": "#BC614E"}`

**Fixed:** Colors are now formatted as CSS hex strings.

---

### [x] 4. Image Alignment Sent as Integer (FIXED)

**Location:** `packages/server/src/protocol.zig:211-226`

**Fixed:** Server now sends alignment as string (`"inlineup"`, etc.) per GlkOte spec.

---

### [x] 5. Buffer Window Content Missing Paragraph Structure (FIXED)

**Location:** `packages/server/src/protocol.zig:188-196`

**Fixed:** Buffer window content now uses paragraph structure:
```json
{"id": 1, "text": [{"append": true, "content": ["Hello world"]}]}
```

---

### [x] 6. Grid Window Content Uses Correct Format (FIXED)

**Location:** `packages/server/src/protocol.zig`, `packages/server/src/state.zig`, `packages/server/src/window.zig`, `packages/server/src/stream.zig`

**Fixed:** Grid windows now use `lines` array with explicit line numbers per GlkOte spec:
```json
{"id": 1, "lines": [{"line": 0, "content": ["text"]}]}
```

**Implementation:**
1. Added cursor position tracking to WindowData struct (cursor_x, cursor_y)
2. Added grid buffer and dirty tracking to WindowData
3. Implemented `glk_window_move_cursor` to update cursor position
4. Created `flushGridWindow` function to send grid content in lines format
5. Modified `putCharToStream` to write to grid buffer for grid windows
6. Grid buffer allocated when grid window is opened, freed on close
7. `glk_window_clear` clears grid buffer and resets cursor

---

### [x] 7. Graphics Window Missing Dedicated Dimension Fields (FIXED)

**Location:** `packages/server/src/protocol.zig:168-186`

**Fixed:** Graphics windows now include both `graphwidth`/`graphheight` (canvas size) and `width`/`height` (window size).

---

### [ ] 8. Window Positions Always Zero

**Location:** `packages/server/src/protocol.zig:176-185`

**Current:** `left` and `top` always set to 0.

**Spec:** Should reflect actual window layout positions for proper rendering.

---

### [x] 9. Metrics Object Complete (FIXED)

**Location:** `packages/server/src/protocol.zig`, `packages/client/src/protocol.ts`, `packages/client/src/worker/messages.ts`

**Fixed:** Added all GlkOte spec metrics fields:
- `outspacingx`, `outspacingy` - outer spacing
- `inspacingx`, `inspacingy` - inner spacing between windows
- `gridcharwidth`, `gridcharheight` - grid character dimensions
- `gridmarginx`, `gridmarginy` - grid margins
- `buffercharwidth`, `buffercharheight` - buffer character dimensions
- `buffermarginx`, `buffermarginy` - buffer margins
- `graphicsmarginx`, `graphicsmarginy` - graphics margins

Client sends all fields with sensible defaults. Grid/buffer specific char dimensions fall back to generic charwidth/charheight. Spacing and margins default to 0.

---

## Missing Input Event Handling

These are input events the display can send that wasiglk doesn't handle.

```

**Fixed:**
1. Added `current_hyperlink` field to global state

## Code Quality Improvements

### [ ] Refactor Zig Protocol to Use Structs Instead of String Concatenation

**Location:** `packages/server/src/protocol.zig`

**Current state:** Many protocol messages are built using manual string formatting and concatenation (e.g., `std.fmt.bufPrint` with inline JSON strings). This is error-prone and hard to maintain.

**Goal:** Define proper Zig structs that match the GlkOte/RemGLK JSON schema, then use Zig's built-in JSON serialization (`std.json`). This will:
- Document the protocol schema clearly in code
- Leverage Zig's optional fields and default values for clean struct definitions
- Eliminate manual string escaping and formatting bugs
- Make the code more maintainable and self-documenting

**Example of current approach (avoid):**
```zig
const json = std.fmt.bufPrint(&buf,
    \\{{"type":"update","gen":{d},"content":[{{"id":{d},"text":[...]}}]}}
, .{ generation, win_id }) catch return;
```

**Example of desired approach:**
```zig
const TextParagraph = struct {
    append: ?bool = null,
    flowbreak: ?bool = null,
    content: ?[]const ContentSpan = null,
};

const ContentUpdate = struct {
    id: u32,
    clear: ?bool = null,
    text: ?[]const TextParagraph = null,
    lines: ?[]const GridLine = null,
    draw: ?[]const DrawOperation = null,
};

const StateUpdate = struct {
    type: []const u8 = "update",
    gen: u32,
    windows: ?[]const WindowUpdate = null,
    content: ?[]const ContentUpdate = null,
    input: ?[]const InputRequest = null,
    timer: ?u32 = null,
};

// Then serialize with:
writeJson(StateUpdate{ .gen = generation, .content = &content_updates });
```

**Note:** Refactor incrementally as we fix other protocol issues. When touching a function that uses string concatenation, convert it to use structs.

## Notes

- The TypeScript client (`packages/client/src/protocol.ts`) may compensate for some server-side issues
- Some features (sound) are intentionally stubbed and not listed here
- Test with actual GlkOte to verify fixes work with the reference implementation
